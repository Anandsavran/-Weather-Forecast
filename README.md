Real -time Weather prediction dashboard.
🌦️ Real Weather Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview

Real Weather Analytics Dashboard is a data analytics project built using Microsoft Power BI that analyzes real-time and historical weather data fetched from an external API.

The dashboard transforms raw JSON weather data into meaningful insights using interactive visualizations, DAX measures, and KPI indicators.

This project demonstrates:

API Data Integration

Data Cleaning & Transformation
 
DAX Calculations

Time Intelligence Analysis

Interactive Dashboard Design

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

📊 Microsoft Power BI

🌐 REST API Integration

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

🔄 Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

📁 JSON to Tabular Conversion

📡 Data Source

Weather data is collected from:

Website: WeatherAPI.com

Data Type: Real-time & Historical Weather Data

Format: JSON (Converted into structured table format)

Parameters Included:

Date & Time

Location

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Wind Speed (km/h)

Precipitation (mm)

Atmospheric Pressure (mb)

Weather Condition

🔄 Data Preprocessing Steps

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and transformed:

Extracted data using API endpoint

Converted JSON into structured tabular format

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing/null values

Converted date-time into proper format

Standardized units (°C, km/h, mm)

Renamed columns for readability

📊 Key Dashboard Features
🌡️ 1. Temperature Analysis

Average Temperature Measure

Temperature Variance (Actual vs Feels Like)

Heat Index / Wind Chill Comparison

24-hour Trend Visualization

⏳ 2. Time Intelligence

Previous Day Temperature

Week-over-Week Change

Dynamic Date Comparison using DAX

🌬️ 3. Wind Classification

Wind speed categorized into:

Calm

Breeze

Moderate

High Wind

Extreme

🎨 4. Dynamic Conditional Formatting

Red → Hot (>30°C)

Yellow → Mild

Blue → Cold

🌧️ 5. Rainfall Risk KPI

High Risk Alert if precipitation > 2.5mm

Flood Risk Indicator

📈 Business Objectives
Objective 1: Temperature & Comfort Analysis

Compare actual temperature vs "Feels Like"

Identify comfort variations

Found 2–4°C difference in high humidity scenarios

Objective 2: Precipitation & Humidity Trends

Analyze correlation between humidity & rainfall

Observed precipitation mostly when humidity > 85%

📌 Key Insights

Real-time API integration allows dynamic reporting

Temperature fluctuations correlate with humidity & wind patterns

High humidity significantly impacts perceived temperature

Precipitation probability increases after 85% humidity
